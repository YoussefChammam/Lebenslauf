    <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
      I am 19 years old and a junior web developer that is currently studying a bachelor's degree in computer science. It is now my third semester in HTW Berlin. I aspire to build things, preferably in teams. I am driven into the nft space and the blockchain. Web2 is outdated, decentralization is the new silicon valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always had a scientific mind, that I am really thankful for. I am really sceptic and if you want to define me in a word, it would probably be curious. Keep asking questions, because like Einstein says, the biggest loss is a mind that doesn't do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am an introvert that doesn't stop learning each day, mostly through articles and books, podcasts. But also through people. Networking is not my biggest issue too.

    <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ learning</h2>

    <p>
     I didn't build a huge project yet, but I am currently working on 2 or 3 at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started my cs journey with python coding to learn the basics of programming, but that didn't last much. Also created a trading bot with python.
      After that I started learning java in the university and got into object-oriented-programming. I can say that I have an average knowledge in it by now. I have done a few projects with htw in java, and also one on my own, which is a messaging app.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I got into crypto, and got the chance to understand blockchain and smart contracts. So I started learning solidity. I have then made one token on binance smart chain and deployed it on testnet.
      Since half of smart contracts is in frontend, I got into front-end development.
      Bought me that unfinished udemy course and started with the basics.
      After 6 months of learning, I can now code a nice user interface  with html,css, javascript (framework : react).
    </p>

    <h2>üèÜ Projects</h2>

    <p>
      Apart from my work with school, I am currently building an NFT smart contract and another dapp called middleman.
      My goal from here to 6 months is to make those two projects go live. The collection is a team work, and the dapp is me myself and I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the full stack developer behind the nft collection. I am in charge of designing a cool interface that is attractive, with the languages I referred to.
      In the backend I will be working with node.js, web3.js and of course solidity.
      In the other hand, I am also building middleman on the ethereum blockchain. Stay tuned ot hear more about it ! It is very promising.
      And here I am trying three.js to start 3D on the nft collection interface.
