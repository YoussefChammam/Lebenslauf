    <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
      I am a 20 years old young self-taught web3 developer that is currently studying a bachelor's degree in computer science. It is now my fourth semester in HTW Berlin. I aspire to build things, preferably in teams. I am driven into the nft space, defi and the blockchain technology in general and its added value to our world that helps innovate things, making them automated and decentralized. Web2 is outdated, decentralization is the new silicon valley.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always had a scientific mind, that I am really thankful for, because it comes with two features that I really find essential for building : Scepticism and curiosity. I am really sceptic and if I can describe myself in a word it would definitely be curious. Keep asking questions, because like Einstein says, the biggest loss is a mind that doesn't do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      I keep learning on a daily basis. And that's literally what I do for fun.<br>
      I don't mind starting back from scratch even if I have already sunk my teeth deep in a code, because I believe that it will only make things better.
